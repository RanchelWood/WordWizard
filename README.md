# WordWizard
Hello there! I'm the software "WordWizard"'s solo developer RanchelWood. The following content consists of three parts: personal methodology towards expanding voc, tutorial for using the software, and finally, the structure of it. 

So, without further ado, that's jump on in!

## Personal Thoughts about Voc-learning

It is always my opinion that "words" themselves is NEVER alone. **They come with sentences.** Every time you encounter a word, you note it down **WITH THE SENTENCE**,and check it out multiple times, and it's in your pocket. In other words, in terms of memorizing (and mastering) it, sentences that you are familiar with matters.

However, currently there is (surprisingly) so few softwares that satisfy such requirements: test the word you chosen by your own sentences. 

Thus, here comes Word Wizard! It features the functionality for user to **create personal entry for each word**, and **test them using the stored sentences**. 

So how to use this? 


## Tutorial of WordWizard

It is worth noting that the software run 100% locally. No internet needed, and no risk of leaking your personal info. 

### Installation

It's as simply as it could be. Download the .zip pack, unpack it in a folder where you'd like to store the entire software. You may create a shortcut for the WordWizard.exe file. Double click it, and it's done. 

### Home Page & Word Test popup window

Here's where you could test the words within your vault. 
> You must first select one or more words in the Inventory Page to open the word-testing popup window!

If you press the button `Of course`, the program will skip to the next word.

Differences between `Now I get it!` and `errr...`: the former will automatically oncheck the review box on the next page. But you can change it later whatsoever.
